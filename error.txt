the one problem i have faced that


KafkaJSGroupCoordinatorNotFound: Failed to find group coordinator
    at Cluster.findGroupCoordinatorMetadata (C:\Users\HP\java script\demo\node_modules\kafkajs\src\cluster\index.js:420:11)


which is basically kafka didnt find any coorodinate to communicate with my consumer grp .
the problem was with in compsoe-yml file config . bcz in it kafka only have single cluster .
when  we perform transaction we need extra meta data call . so we must have a coordinator broker .
so we again rewrite the compose file with two ports 9092 and 9093 ehich are for normal broker and coordinator broker.
keep the two ports different,.

and always use messages in await transaction.send({
    topic:
    messages:
})
